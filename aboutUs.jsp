ABOUT US <br></br>
Team Six &#931; Incorporated has diligently worked on developing an all encompassing laptop 
information site for prospective laptop purchasers during the Fall 2014 semester. This 
website will provide consumers with all the information they will need to make a well-informed 
decision regarding their potential laptop purchase. This includes: detailed definitions of confusing 
laptop terms, various laptop brands and models (including their specifications), stores with laptops 
available for purchase, and categories that distinguish consumers' laptop usage behaviours for easier 
laptop differentiation.
